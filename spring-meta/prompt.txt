 a landscape wallpaper with spring scenery of 2 branches of cherry blossom tree peeking in from top left corner, carrying huge soft blossoms that are slowly falling, sparingly placed on the branches on which no green leaves are visible. One branch covers top border of image and one peeks in from lower left corner. The tree is close to and over the photographer which each blossom flower and even its anthers visible separately, as the photographer is standing right before these 2 branches. The blossoms appear to be size of palms of hands and within reach. These branches are in foreground. The background is all under bokeh effect, looking like a dreamy place, which consists of some tall grass yellow flowers filling in a plain field stretching to horizon, covered by a golden sunset in middle right of frame, sitting over the line of sight of the plain field, flowing stardust over them, and a bright sky which is pink near the sun and stretching to purple near top border, the sky has a couple of barely visible vispy clouds. The bokeh covers this sunset, the sky, and the yellow flowers, meanwhile the cherry blossoms are in crisp focus. The bokeh includes translucent ghosting circles and veiling of background
